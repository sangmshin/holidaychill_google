# Holiday Chill for Google Home and Assistant

Created Holiday Chill app duplicate for Google Home and Assistant in NodeJS.

"Instead of sending out a traditional holiday card, Deutsch is giving the gift of relaxation in the form of a new meditation skill for Amazon Alexa, called “Holiday Chill.” Created by Deutsch and powered by its AI practice, Great Machine, “Holiday Chill” includes four holiday-themed meditations guided by Jack Frost, as well as soothing winter soundscapes. This skill is available publicly via the Alexa app store, and the agency has been gifting custom-branded Alexa devices pre-programmed with the skill to clients, colleagues and employees."
